# gVisor Report

## Intro (summary, core domain)
gVisor is a container sandboxer that aims to provide highly isolated environments in which to execute less than fully trusted applications while solving a multitude of problems and inaptitudes inherent to containers and sandboxing with virtual machines. 

In recognition of the gaps in isolation resulting from all containers sharing a single host operating system and all VMs sharing a hypervisor, gVisor provides a user-level implementation of Linux - the Sentry. This user-level application provides the system API to containerized applications while preventing any untrusted application from directly interacting with the host OS. Providing each sandbox with its own independent Sentry prevents untrusted applications from escaping their isolated environment through direct attacks on the shared hypervisor that are possible with traditional sandboxes. While the Sentry implements the Linux system API, the API exposed to guest applications is not identical to that of Linux. Confines are imposed on the set of system calls available to both guest applications and the Sentry itself in order to lessen the attack surface on the system. The attack suface is further diminished by relocating file system operations such as ```open()``` to a seperate module Gofer, independent and isolated from the Sentry.

In addition to its security and isolation goals, gVisor is designed with the intent to minimize start up time for containers. This is evidenced by its main deviation from traditional container sandboxing with virtual machines - rather than creating virtualized hardware for a guest kernel that guest applications will interact with, the system API provided by the Sentry is based directly off the host system API with the Sentry deferring to the host at runtime for some services.

In relation to alternatives to gVisor for isolating less than fully trusted applications for execution on a shared system such as traditional linux containers, gVisor suffers from dreadful performance. The performance hits to gVisor directly result from the exact features of the system that provide the security, isolation, and defense in depth it was built for. While the performance of gVisor lacks in relation to traditional containers, it is optimized for efficient building and destroying of containers and achieves better performance in this than container sandboxes implemented via virtualized hardware and a guest kernel. 

The poor performance of gVisor in memory usage, networking, I/O and more make this system not well suited for extensive applications that execute for longer periods of time and necessitate abuntant resources. gVisor is best suited for serverless frameworks leveraging Function as a Service where applications will be run for short periods of time to provide a service, then are destroyed. The ability of gVisor to quickly build and destroy containers furthers the suitability of the system for serverless frameworks as this infrastructure necessitates multiple instantiations of these containers to execute services for many clients. Clearly minimizing construction and deconstruction time of containers maximizes the effiency and productivity of the service provider.

 Function as a Service has become more prevelent in recent years and cloud computing has grown - gVisor provides the requisite security principles and depth for the execution of untrusted guest applications from a myriad of clients in cloud computation, and is optimized for the Function as a Service model frequently implemented in modern cloud computing. As a result of these core features of gVisor, it is highly suitable and immensely valuable in cloud computing while the performance tradeoffs of these core features make gVisor a poor fit for just about any other purpose or environment.
